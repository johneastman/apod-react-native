# APOD
A mobile app that uses NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API to display the current APOD. This project is a React Native implementation of their [official site](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/).

This project replaces the [old Android app](https://github.com/johneastman/APOD), which was written in Java.
